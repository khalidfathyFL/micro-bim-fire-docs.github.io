# About MicroBIM

With products boosting efficiency, reliability, and productivity of tedious everyday BIM workflows, **MicroBIM** has been established to revolutionize apps for the everchanging construction industry worldwide. MicroBIM Fire (formerly PipeFab) is software born out of the need to make Revit more adaptable to Fire Design.

Starting in 2017, we initially developed the software to streamline the pipe fabrication process. It has now grown into a complete suite of Fire Design tools for modeling, fabricating, and hydraulically calculating Fire systems. With an experienced team of Fire Design Engineers and Software Developers, we have tailored MicroBIM Fire to make designing in Revit as efficient and accurate as possible.

Working alongside valued clients, providing continuous support and training, **MicroBIM Fire** has changed the way we design Fire Systems in Revit. We are keen to deliver the **MicroBIM Fire** software experience to many more designers and engineers around the world.
